## Stage 1

### Issues that should be fixed after the first review:

[x] Select options combo lists weren't usable on smaller screens
[x] The div with an id of "map" needed an appropiate aria role ( "application" )
[ ] The "breadcrumb" list wasn't compatible with aria structure ( still unsure waiting for validation )
